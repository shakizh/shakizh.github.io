The early developmental stage of the World Wide Web, ranging from the early 1990s to the early
2000s,is the earliest years of the Internet. Websites at that time were static, and most were
just composed of HTML pages displaying the same content for all.The structure used simple HTML
the styling was basic CSS.Resultant pages were simple, having few text contents and little visual
appeal. Design was mainly functional information could be delivered, but the experience of the
end user was not considered.Minimal interaction with the sites by the users was possible. Web 1.0
experience is also described as (read-only), where content is provided by a few creators or
organizations and consumed by many.Users could surf through pages, click on hyperlinks, but
had little or no chance to contribute or create content. This lack of interactivity defined a lot
about this era. Navigation on the earlyweb was done through directories such as the Yahoo!
Directory and early search engines such as AltaVista,which helped users to find their way through
what was really an unstructured digital environment. Early web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape
Navigator were the first tools that gave a large audience access to the web hence, the browsing
experience depended upon them. Web 1.0 also featured slow internet speeds due to the predominance
of dial up connections.The design of the websites had to be simple and light so as to keep loads
fast.Multimedia elements,such as pictures,videos, and audio,were few and far between if used,
most often they required additional plugins like RealPlayer or Flash to view.Despite these limits,
Web 1.0 came forth with the birth of e-commerce.Some of the sites that pioneered the Web 1.0 era,
such as Amazon and eBay,also came forth at the tail end of the Web 1.0. As such,these websites
pioneered online shopping and online auctioning and were a post for the explosion of e-commerce
in the ensuing years.Web 1.0, all in all,was a growth stage in the development of the internet.
It exposed the world to the capabilities of the web with a simple framework for information
exchange and the start of the online transaction. The user experience was limited, as per
modern day standards,but the novelty and the infrastructure built up during this period paved
the way for more advanced, dynamic,and user centric web experiences that define the
Web 2.0 and beyond.

<pre class="web">
The Web 2.0 represents an epoch of change in the evolution of the internet from static read-only
web pages to dynamic and interactive user experiences. Unlike Web 1.0, which was mostly made up 
of static HTML pages with very limited means for user interactivity, Web 2.0 ushered in the 
platform where users could participate, collaborate, and create. This new phase of the web 
emphasized usability, interoperability, and user-generated contentâ€”that drastically changed how 
information was shared and consumed online.Some of the major, quintessential features of Web 2.0
include the proliferation of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
Such social media platforms revolutionized the way people interact with each other. These 
platforms allow their users to set up profiles, share updates, and communicate with a global 
audience. Blogs and wikis became very popular, too, wherein a person could publish their
thoughts or share their knowledge or even work on a group project in real time. The video-sharing
platform, YouTube, offered an opportunity for users to upload, view, and share videos. This meant
newer forms of entertainment and ways to spread information.One of the other important
features of Web 2.0 is that it has popularized the idea of folksonomies, which allows the 
collective generation and management of tags, labeling, and categorization of content by users. 
It's a user-driven approach towards content organization; this made information more accessible
and easily discoverable. In addition,rich internet applications, shortened as RIAs,were developed 
using technologies such as AJAX,or Asynchronous JS and XML,hence providing more interactive
and responsive web applications to enhance the user experience.Web 2.0 fueled the growth of
electronic commerce and general business models. Other firms, like Amazon and eBay, leveraged 
user-generated content, such as in the form of reviews and ratings, for building trust and driving 
sales. Web 2.0 also enabled collective efforts to crowdsourcing and crowdfunding platforms, where
people could pool their efforts toward a specific initiative or project.Web 2.0 has an impact 
that runs very deep in society, through its democratization of information and the empowerment of 
people, hence facilitating global connectivity. It has changed the way we communicate,
share knowledge, and do business, connecting people with an interactive and participative web.
As we further progress towards Web 3.0 and whatever else follows, the premises and innovations
that Web 2.0 brought surely will keep affecting the digital landscape.

Web 3.0, mostly referred to as the decentralized web, is a revolutionary overhaul in the way 
the internet works, emphasizing decentralization, empowering the user, and strengthening privacy.
Web 3.0 seeks to distribute this power, compared to Web 2.0, which is centrally biased, holding
control over vast amounts of data and user content by just a few corporations. This is done with
the help of blockchain technology and dApps, working on a peer-to-peer basis with no middleman in 
between.One of the most core elements of Web 3.0 is decentralization. Web 3.0 will be a movement, 
shifting from data being stored in centralized servers, instead to a distributed network of nodes. 
This concept also enhances security because it reduces the idea of a single point of failure. 
The more nodes the network has, the more difficult it is for hackers to exploit in the case of 
data breaches and access attempts. Decentralization will also prevent censorship because one will 
have assured accessibility to information without modification.Other advanced technologies 
included in Web 3.0 are the integration of artificial intelligence, semantic web, and others. 
AI helps to create more intelligent and personalized user experiences because it can understand 
and process a lot of data to make decisions. A semantic web will enhance the ability of machines 
to understand and interpret human language, thus enabling convenient data sharing and connectivity 
between systems.Another important aspect of Web 3.0 is how the system addresses issues related to
user identity and privacy.It will be through decentralized identity systems that users will
have total control over their personal information and data and get to choose what to share
and with whom.This approach creates a safer online environment that protects users against
identity theft and data misuse.Web 3.0 is also destined to change industries by providing
novel ways of interaction and transaction. Take the financial sector, for example:
decentralized finance platforms allow users to transact directly with each other without
going through traditional financial intermediaries.This not only cuts costs but increases
access to financial services.The promise of Web 3.0 extends beyond the scope of technical
improvements to engendering an open,transparent, and collaborative internet.By empowering
innovation and involvement by a multitude of users and developers, Web 3.0 has the potential
to reshape the digital landscape, open new opportunities,and address the limitations of 
the current web.In a nutshell,Web 3.0 is an internet evolution characterized by decentralization, 
advanced privacy,and smart technologies. It seeks to empower the user by giving them complete 
control over his data and interactions and by making the online environment more secure and 
innovative. As this new paradigm evolves, it promises to change the way we interact with the 
digital world, making it more inclusive, transparent, and resilient.
